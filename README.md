A cross-platform C# editor and playground with enhanced dependency caching and NuGet resolution.

> **Note**: This is a fork of the original [NetPad project](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad) with performance optimizations for script dependency resolution.

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

This fork includes significant performance improvements for NuGet dependency handling:

- **Per-Package Caching**: Individual NuGet packages are cached separately for optimal reuse across scripts
- **Smart Cache Strategy**: Dependencies are loaded from cache when available, avoiding repeated downloads
- **Data Connection Caching**: Database connection resources are cached to avoid regeneration
- **Async Parallel Processing**: Uses Task.WhenAll for concurrent dependency loading instead of blocking operations

## Get Started

NetPad is a C# playground that lets you run C# code instantly, without the hassle of creating and
managing projects. Open NetPad, start coding, hit Run, and see your output immediately. It's that
simple.

- **Prototyping and Testing:** Quickly prototype and test code snippets before incorporating them
  into your projects.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data interactively for better insights and analysis.
- **Database Queries:** Query databases using LINQ or SQL effortlessly.
- **Learn and Experiment:** Experiment with new C# features or start learning C# in an intuitive and
  accessible environment.
- **Utility Scripts:** Create and save your own utility or administration scripts for repeated use.

See [Features](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad?tab=readme-ov-file#features-rocket).

## Motivation

We love LINQPad, but we miss its tremendous utility when working on non-Windows platforms.
This project aims to create an open-source, web-enabled, cross-platform alternative.

The goal isn't to reach 100% feature parity with LINQPad, but to offer an effective alternative that
covers features most commonly used and to introduce a few new useful ones.

## Requirements

The following must be installed to use NetPad:

* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (v6 or later)

Additional requirement if you plan to create and use database connections:

* [EF Core tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) (v6 or later)

## Download

### Official Installers

**[Download Now!](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/releases)**

NetPad has 2 release channels:

- **Stable**: The Electron.js version of NetPad. Installers that start with `netpad`
- **vNext**: Uses a native Rust-based shell. Installers that start with `netpad_vnext`

Both channels have the same feature set. The native vNext version is lighter on system resources and
will eventually
become the main package. At which point, the Electron version will be deprecated.

> On **macOS**
> see [this](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/wiki/Troubleshooting#netpad-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash)
> if you have trouble opening NetPad.

## Updates

NetPad automatically checks for updates each time you start the application and will notify
you when a new version is available.

Automatic updates are not supported, but will be added in the future to make updating
as seamless as possible. Stay tuned for future updates!

The latest version can be downloaded from
the [Releases](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/releases) page.

## About This Fork

This is a performance-optimized fork of NetPad that introduces intelligent dependency caching to improve script execution startup times.

### Key Changes

- **Enhanced Dependency Caching**: Added smart caching mechanism in `ClientServerScriptRunner.Setup.cs`
- **Cache Invalidation Strategy**: Implemented hash-based cache keys that automatically invalidate when dependencies change
- **Performance Improvements**: Significant reduction in script compilation time for complex dependency graphs

### Original Project

### How it works

NetPad runs an ASP.NET web app that hosts a web user interface. It can be
packaged as a desktop app or served and accessed on any browser.

Communication between the user interface and the ASP.NET backend occurs via HTTP
and SignalR.
